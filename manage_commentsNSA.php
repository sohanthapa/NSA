<?
// When someone submits a comment, they "POST" the comment to the server.
// Therefore, we only want to insert a comment to the database if there
// is POST data. The if statement below checks to see if someone has
// posted data to the page
if($_POST)
{
  // At this point in the code, we know someone has posted data and
  // is trying to post a comment. We therefore need to now connect
  // to the database

  // Below we are setting up our connection to the server. Because
  // the database lives on the same physical server as our php code,
  // we are connecting to "localhost". inmoti6_myuser and mypassword
  // are the username and password we setup for our database when
  // using the "MySQL Database Wizard" within cPanel
  $con = mysql_connect("localhost","root","");

  // The statement above has just tried to connect to the database.
  // If the connection failed for any reason (such as wrong username
  // and or password, we will print the error below and stop execution
  // of the rest of this php script
  if (!$con)
  {
    die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }

  // We now need to select the particular database that we are working with
  // In this example, we setup (using the MySQL Database Wizard in cPanel) a
  // database named inmoti6_mysite
  mysql_select_db('_mysite', $con);

  // We now need to create our INSERT command to insert the user's
  // comment into the database.
  //
  // Let's first take a look at the sample INSERT code we received when we
  // used phpMyAdmin to create a test comment:
  //
  // INSERT INTO `inmoti6_mysite`.`comments` (`id`, `name`, `email`, `website`,
  // `comment`, `timestamp`, `articleid`) VALUES (NULL, 'John Smith',
  // 'johns@domain.com', 'johnsmith.com', 'This is a test comment.',
  // CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '1');
  //
  // If we ran this command, it would insert the same exact comment from John
  // Smith every time. What we need to do is update this query so that it
  // includes all of the data that the user typed in.
  //
  // When we setup our HTML Form, some of the text boxes we used were:
  // <input type='text' name='name' id='name' />
  // <input type='text' name='email' id='email' />
  // The important information we need from this is the "id" that is set.
  // For example, to get the user's name, we can grab the 'name'. To
  // get their email address, we need to get the value of 'email'.
  //
  // Using the $_POST variable, we can get this data. This is what we're
  // doing below
  $users_name = $_POST['name'];
  $users_email = $_POST['email'];
  $users_comment = $_POST['comment'];

  // We now have all of the data that the user inputed. What you don't want
  // to do is trust the user's input. Savy users / hackers may attempt to use
  // an sql injection attack in order to run sql statements that you did not
  // intend to run. For example, the following is a basic query for checking
  // someone's username and password:
  //
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='USERNAME' AND password='PASSWORD'
  //
  // In the above, we're assuming the user typed USERNAME as their username and
  // PASSWORD as their PASSWORD. But, what if the user typed the following as
  // their password?
  //
  // ' OR ''='
  //
  // The new query would then be the following:
  //
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='USERNAME' AND password='' OR ''=''
  //
  // Running the above query would allow anyone to login as any user! We can use
  // the mysql_real_escape_string function to escape the user's input. If used in
  // the above example, the new query would read:
  //
  // SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='USERNAME' AND password='\' OR \'\'=\''
  //
  // Because the single quotes are "escaped" (i.e. appended with a backslash), the
  // hackers attempt would fail.
  $users_name = mysql_real_escape_string($users_name);
  $users_email = mysql_real_escape_string($users_email);
  $users_comment = mysql_real_escape_string($users_comment);

  // We also need to get the article id, so we know if the comment belongs
  // to page 1 or if it belongs to page 2. The article id is going to be
  // passed in the URL. For example, looking at this URL:
  //
  // http://phpandmysql.inmotiontesting.com/page1.php?id=1
  //
  // The article id is 1. To get data from the url, use the $_GET variable,
  // as in:

  // We also want to add a bit of security here as well. We assume that the $article_id
  // is a number, but if someone changes the URL, as in this manner:
  // http://phpandmysql.inmotiontesting.com/page2.php?id=malicious_code_goes_here
  // ... then they will have the potential to run any code they want in your
  // database. The following code will check to ensure that $article_id is a number.
  // If it is not a number (IE someone is trying to hack your website), it will tell
  // the script to stop executing the page

  // At this point, we've grabbed all of the data that we need. We now need
  // to update our SQL query. For example, instead of "John Smith", we'll
  // use $users_name. Below is our updated SQL command:
  $query = "
   INSERT INTO `_mysite`.`comments` (`id`, `name`, `email`,
      `comment`, `time`, `articleid`) VALUES ('NULL', '$users_name',
      '$users_email','$users_comment',
      CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '1');";

 // Our SQL stated is stored in a variable called $query. To run the SQL command
// we need to execute what is in the $query variable.
 mysql_query($query,$con);
 if(! $query)
 {
   die('Could not enter data: '. mysql_error());
 }
  ob_start();
  echo "<h2>Thank you for your Comment!</h2>";
  header("Refresh:1;http://localhost/contact.html");
  exit();
  ob_end_flush();
  // We can inform the user to what's going on by printing a message to
  // the screen using php's echo function
  // At this point, we've added the user's comment to the database, and we can
  // now close our connection to the database:
  mysql_close($con);
}
